    Defects (String): number of cork stoppers with defect vs without defect
        /b1/defect_found
        /b2/defect_found
        /b3/defect_found

            Example:
                5/7
                    5 - Cork with defect
                    7 - Cork without defect
    
    Loadcells (Float32): weight in the load cells.
                        IF load cell value >=100 THEN robot should empty it

        /b2/loadcell_defect
        /b3/loadcell_defect

        /b1/loadcell_no_defect (Ivan)
        /b2/loadcell_no_defect
        /b3/loadcell_no_defect
